This program requires the use of the Intel Realsense T265 camera, which,leveraging 
its combined camera and imu,allows for precise positional data to be aquired.

To modify contents, CMake is required. For more information on how to use CMake,
please visit the CMake website for instructional tutorials. Feel free to reach
out to me if you have any questions. 

For the Intel Realsense software, please download version v. 2.24, which can be found with this link:
